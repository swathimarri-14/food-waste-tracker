A "food waste tracker" is a system, software, or a process used to measure, monitor, and analyze food waste in households, food service, and retail sectors to identify patterns and reduce the amount of food discarded. Key aspects of food waste tracking include recording the type and quantity of wasted food, the time and reason for waste (e.g., spoilage, overproduction), and even the cost of the waste
